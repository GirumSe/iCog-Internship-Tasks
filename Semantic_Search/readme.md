# **semantic search**

Semantic search is a sophisticated data searching technique that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to enhance the accuracy and relevance of search results. Unlike traditional keyword-based search methods, which focus solely on exact term matches, semantic search aims to understand the user's intent and the contextual meaning of their queries.

Most of time, semantic search works as follows:
- It uses a [text embedding](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-embeddings-comprehensive-guide-afd97fce8fb5) to turn words into vectors (lists of numbers).
- Uses [similarity](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/22997) to find the vector among the responses which is the most similar to the vector corresponding to the query.
- Outputs the response corresponding to this most similar vector.

## **Text embeddings**

Text embeddings are a way to represent words and sentences as vectors in a high-dimensional space. the evolution of embeddings starts from bag-of-words which does't take to account semantic meanings, so  TF-IDF (Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency) come to existence, which try to give wights as a vector for words in order to calculate the relevance of words in a corpus, but this representation create a sparse vector where the length of the vector is equal to the corpus size, while not garbing that much of the semantic meaning. Looking at this, scientists started to think about dense vector representation. that is the birth of modern vector embeddings.

For word embeddings, each word is converted into a vector that captures its meaning based on its meaning in a large corpus of text, This allows words with similar meanings or contexts to be placed closer together in the space. Sentence embeddings extend this concept to entire sentences, representing them as single vectors that encapsulate the overall meaning of the sentence. Methods like [Word2Vec](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/word2vec) and [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) are commonly used for word embeddings, while more advanced models like [Sentence-BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10084) are used for generating sentence embeddings. 

When using word embeddings in semantic search, the first step involves converting both the user's query and the documents in the search index into numerical vector representations. For the query, each word is transformed into a vector using a pre-trained word embedding model, resulting in a query vector that captures the semantic meaning of the entire query. Similarly, documents are also converted into vectors, either by averaging the word vectors within them or by using sentence embeddings that capture the meaning of the whole text. These embeddings allow the search system to understand the content's meaning, enabling more contextually relevant search results. the we will proceed into calculating similarity between the query and the data(responses) we have.

## **Calculating Similarity**

Once you have vector embeddings for both queries and responses, you need to measure the similarity between these vectors to find the most relevant responses. Here are the main methods used for this purpose:

### 1. **Cosine Similarity**

**Description**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It is often used to determine how similar two vectors are in terms of their direction, regardless of their magnitude.

**Formula**: *cosine_similarity(A, B)* = $\frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}$ 

**Advantages**:
- **Magnitude-Independent**: Effective when the magnitude of vectors may vary, as it focuses only on the direction.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to compute and interpret.
- **Effective in High-Dimensional Spaces**: Works well with text embeddings, which are often high-dimensional.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Does Not Capture Magnitude**: Might miss nuances if magnitude differences carry significant meaning.
- **Not Suitable for Sparse Data**: Less effective with highly sparse vectors.

### 2. **Euclidean Distance**

**Description**: Measures the straight-line distance between two points (vectors) in space. It considers both the magnitude and direction of the vectors.

**Formula**: *euclidean_distance (A, B)* = $\sqrt{\sum_{i}(A_i - B_i)^2}$

**Advantages**:
- **Magnitude Consideration**: Takes into account the magnitude of vectors.
- **Intuitive**: Simple geometric interpretation.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Magnitude Sensitivity**: Can be affected by the scale of the vectors, which might lead to misleading results if vectors are not normalized.
- **Not Ideal for High Dimensions**: Can become less informative in very high-dimensional spaces due to the "curse of dimensionality."

### 3. **Dot Product**

**Description**: Computes the sum of the products of corresponding entries of two vectors. It indicates how much two vectors align.

**Formula**: *dot_product (A, B)* = $\sum_{i}(A_i \cdot B_i)$

**Advantages**:
- **Alignment Measurement**: Effective for understanding how well two vectors align.
- **Computationally Efficient**: Simple to calculate and fast.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Magnitude Influence**: Results are affected by the magnitude of vectors, which might not always be desirable.
- **Requires Normalization**: Often needs normalization to avoid skewed results.

### 4. **Manhattan Distance**

**Description**: Measures the sum of absolute differences between corresponding components of two vectors.

**Formula**: *manhattan_distance (A, B)* = $\sum_{i} |A_i - B_i|$

**Advantages**:
- **Robust to Outliers**: Less sensitive to extreme values compared to Euclidean distance.
- **Simple Interpretation**: Easy to understand and compute.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Less Sensitive to Variance**: May not capture the similarity as effectively as Euclidean distance in some contexts.
- **Not Ideal for All Vector Spaces**: Less common for text embeddings compared to other methods.

### 5. **Jaccard Similarity**

**Description**: Measures similarity between finite sample sets by comparing the size of the intersection and union of the sets.

**Formula**: *jaccard_similarity(A, B)* = **$\frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}$**

**Advantages**:
- **Good for Binary Data**: Effective for comparing binary or categorical data.
- **Intuitive**: Easy to understand and compute.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Not Suitable for Dense Vectors**: Less useful for continuous or dense vector embeddings.
- **Limited Application**: Primarily used for sets and categorical data.

### 6. **Minkowski Distance**

**Description**: Generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distances, parameterized by a value \(p\). It includes both L1 (Manhattan) and L2 (Euclidean) as special cases.

**Formula**: *minkowski_distance (A, B)* = $\left(\sum_{i} |A_i - B_i|^p\right)^{1/p}$

**Advantages**:
- **Flexibility**: Allows adjustment of distance sensitivity with different \(p\) values.
- **Generalization**: Includes both Euclidean and Manhattan as special cases.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Computational Complexity**: Can be more complex to compute, especially for large \(p\).
- **Requires Careful Tuning**: The choice of \(p\) affects results and requires careful tuning.

### 7. **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**

**Description**: Measures the linear correlation between two vectors, indicating how well they are linearly related.

**Formula**: *pearson_correlation (A, B)* = $\frac{\text{cov}(A, B)}{\sigma_A \sigma_B}$

**Advantages**:
- **Correlation Measurement**: Useful for understanding linear relationships.
- **Magnitude-Invariant**: Focuses on the relationship rather than the absolute values.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Linear Relationships Only**: Does not capture non-linear relationships.
- **Less Common in NLP**: Less frequently used for text embeddings compared to other similarity measures.

Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use can depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of your semantic search application.

Certainly! Here’s a revised version of the post-similarity processing section:

## **Post-Similarity Processing**

After calculating similarity scores between the query and responses, the next steps involve refining and presenting the results in a way that maximizes their relevance and usefulness. This typically includes ranking, thresholding, and sometimes incorporating user feedback to continuously improve the system.

**Ranking** is a fundamental step where the responses are sorted based on their similarity scores. By arranging the results from most similar to least similar, users are presented with the most relevant information first. This organization helps in quickly identifying and accessing the most pertinent responses, enhancing the overall search experience.

**Thresholding** is used to filter out responses that do not meet a minimum similarity score. This process ensures that only those responses that are sufficiently similar to the query are considered, helping to reduce the noise and improve the quality of results presented to users. The choice of threshold level is crucial, as it determines the balance between including potentially relevant responses and excluding irrelevant ones.

then we can output the response corresponding to this most similar vector.

While semantic search, by finding the nearest neighbors to vector embeddings, is highly effective for understanding the semantic meaning of sentences and documents, it faces a significant challenge: the computational expense because of:- 

1. **High Dimensionality**: Text embeddings are often represented in high-dimensional spaces (e.g., hundreds to thousands of dimensions). Calculating distances or similarities in these high-dimensional spaces can be computationally intensive.

2. **Large Number of Vectors**: In practical applications, the number of vectors (representing documents, sentences, or other text units) can be very large. Computing pairwise similarities between the query vector and all response vectors involves a substantial amount of calculations, which can lead to performance bottlenecks.

3. **Exact Nearest Neighbor Search**: Finding the exact nearest neighbors involves a full comparison of the query vector with every vector in the dataset. As the dataset grows, this exhaustive search becomes slower and less feasible.

### **Techniques to Address Computational Challenges**

To mitigate these challenges, several techniques are employed:

#### **1. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search Algorithms**

ANN search algorithms are designed to find approximate rather than exact nearest neighbors, which significantly reduces computational complexity and speeds up the search process. Some popular ANN techniques include:

- **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**: This method hashes high-dimensional vectors into buckets such that similar vectors are likely to be hashed into the same bucket. By only comparing vectors within the same bucket, LSH reduces the number of comparisons required.
  
- **Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)**: This algorithm constructs a graph-based structure where nodes are connected based on their similarity. It navigates through this graph to find approximate nearest neighbors efficiently.

- **Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)**: Developed by Spotify, Annoy builds a forest of random projection trees to quickly find approximate nearest neighbors.

#### **2. Dimensionality Reduction**

Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to reduce the number of dimensions in the vector space while preserving the essential semantic information. This reduction helps in speeding up similarity calculations. Common techniques include:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA reduces the dimensionality of the vector space by projecting vectors onto a lower-dimensional subspace that captures the most variance.

- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: t-SNE is often used for visualizing high-dimensional data by mapping it to a lower-dimensional space, which can also facilitate faster similarity calculations.

- **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)**: UMAP is a more recent technique that balances preserving local and global structure in the data while reducing dimensionality.

#### **3. Indexing Structures**

Indexing structures are data structures that help in organizing and querying high-dimensional vectors efficiently:

- **KD-Trees**: KD-trees are binary trees used for partitioning space into regions to speed up nearest neighbor searches. They work well for low to moderate dimensions but can become less effective as dimensionality increases.

- **Ball Trees**: Ball trees partition the data into a hierarchical structure of nested balls (spherical regions), which can be more effective than KD-trees in higher-dimensional spaces.

- **Inverted Index**: While typically used in text search, inverted indices can also be adapted for semantic search by indexing the vectors based on their quantized representations.

### **Combining Techniques**

In practice, a combination of these techniques is often used to achieve an optimal balance between search accuracy and computational efficiency. For example, dimensionality reduction might be applied before using an ANN algorithm to further improve performance.

By employing these techniques, semantic search systems can handle large-scale datasets more efficiently, providing faster and more scalable search solutions while maintaining the relevance and accuracy of search results.

3. **Bias in Search Results**:
   - **Solution**: Apply **fairness-aware algorithms** that ensure diverse and representative results.
   - **Improvement**: Implement **feedback loops** where user interactions are used to continuously refine and adjust the search model to mitigate biases.

4. **Improving Recall and Precision**:
   - **Solution**: Use **ensemble methods** that combine different similarity metrics or search techniques to cover more ground.
   - **Improvement**: Fine-tune the **threshold settings** for similarity metrics to balance between recall and precision based on the specific use case.

5. **Scaling with Large Datasets**:
   - **Solution**: Utilize distributed computing frameworks like **Spark** or **Dask** for scaling search operations across large datasets.
